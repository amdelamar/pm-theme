# Custom Themes for ProtonMail

**NOTE: THIS REPO IS ARCHIVED AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED.** It will remain up for historical reference however.

This is a collection of simple color themes for the [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) v3.16.x web app. ðŸŽ¨

[Copy the CSS directly](https://amdelamar.com/pm-theme/themes/bg-image-theme.min.css) and [customize](#customize) the variable `--image` to your own image url. (Might not work with Content-Security-Policy blocking remote content anymore.)

&nbsp;

## GM Theme

[Copy the CSS directly](https://amdelamar.com/pm-theme/themes/gm-theme.min.css) and [edit the colors](#customize).

&nbsp;

## Customize

1. Copy a CSS theme above.
1. Paste in ProtonMail under `Settings` > `Appearance` > `Custom Theme`.
1. Customize the colors (or leave default).
1. Enjoy!

You can customize the theme colors to your liking:

```css
/* First paste any CSS theme. */

/* Now you can set your colors. */
:root {
    --theme1: #3652d1; /* Blue instead of Red */
}
```

The `#xxx` value is [hexidecimal color](https://www.color-hex.com/) value. And the `root` keyword is a CSS variable, that just sets the color values globally. These themes have been simplified to **7 "core" colors** so you can easily make a custom color palette of your choice. You can also generate a pretty [color palette from this site](https://coolors.co/).

```css
:root {
/* Core Theme Colors */
    --theme1: #66669a; /* Purple */
    --theme2: #5f5f60; /* Dark Grey */
    --theme3: #f0f0f0; /* Light Grey */
    --theme4: #bcbdbf; /* Grey */
    --theme5: #797a7c; /* Medium Grey */
    --theme6: #9397cd; /* Light Purple */
    --theme7: #fefefe; /* White */
}
```

Enjoy!

## Notes

- This is only available for the WEB version and not the MOBILE app.
- Some of these themes aren't always the best. **If you have any problems** you can open an [issue here](https://github.com/amdelamar/pm-theme/issues).
- If you're trying to use `@import`, the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header blocks `@import` statements from loading remote content. To get around this, please copy and paste the entire contents of the CSS theme rather than the `@import` line.

## Privacy and Performance

~~The above code used a CSS `import` statement for ease of use and quickly trying out a theme. However, the CSS `import` statement causes files to load sequentially instead of parallel, thus slowing down your pages load performance. Also, if your privacy is of the utmost importance, then I wouldn't use the CSS `import` statment from above. It potentially could reveal your behavior e.g. identifying *when* you load up ProtonMail using *which* specific theme. To avoid this, please copy & paste the entire contents of the CSS file, rather than use the `import` statement.~~ This is no longer a concern, now that the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) Header blocks `@import` statements from loading remote content.
